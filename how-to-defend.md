## Thesis Format

Detailed [formatting specifications can be found on the SGS website](https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/current-students/program-completion/formatting/)

_WEIRD NOTE_: If you say "we" instead of "I" in your chapters, you have to specify the authors

### Introduction
Most faculty no longer require an extensive literature survey as the first chapter in the thesis; however, the students **must provide the readers with sufficient background to put their work in the context of the field**. Students should discuss the length of the Introduction chapter with their supervisor and supervisory committee; in EEB, they are **at least 10-15 double-spaced pages long** (not including references, figures, tables).  

If the student wishes and the supervisor(s) agrees, the student may write part of the Introduction chapter as a popular science article, as an opinion piece, or as a review article, with the intention of publishing it. 

### Conclusion

The Conclusion chapter should include a series of concluding statements that link the findings in the research chapters.  This chapter is typically 5-25 pages in length.

## Exit Seminar

The talk should be **40-50 minutes** in length, but Helen says it's a good idea to schedule a 65-75 minute time slot so that you have time for a break before the *in camera* portion of the defense

Specify format on the **Final Oral Exam (FOE) booking form**

The student **should contact the seminar coordinator** on their campus well in advance so that a date, time, and place for the seminar can be arranged; the **EEB Graduate Office and Helen Rodd should also be notified** of the time and place of the exit seminar.

It is recommended that you propose the timing to the Graduate Coordinator before submitting the booking form

**Kitty or SGS will book the room** – inform them of any special requirements for equipment or venue (*e.g.* accessibility concerns; video conferencing equipment...)

## Exam Committee

- Consists of 4-6 voting members
	- quorum = 4 members
	- at least 5 members are recommended in case of casualties
- Voting members include: 
	- supervisor (and co-supervisor)
	- external examiner (see details below)
	- members of the supervisory committee (no more than 3)
	- A chair (chosen by SGS)
	- 1-2 members of EEB who have not been closely involved in supervision of the thesis
		- must be approved by EEB
- Up to 2 additional non-voting members may be included; if they are not U of T SGS faculty, SGS will need to approve them beforehand  

## External Examiner

[EEB Procedures for Recommending an External Examiner](https://eeb.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/EEB-External-Examiner-Nomination-Information-and-Form_July-10-2021.pdf)

This link includes the **External Nominee for Final  Oral PhD Exam Form** (pg. 3)

- The name of one proposed examiner must be submitted to Helen and Kitty at least **eight weeks** before the exam date 
- Will provide comments on the thesis **two weeks** before the examination so that you can prepare responses to their questions
- The examiner will receive a small honourarium and SGS will cover travel expenses up to $500; additional funds are available if they give a departmental seminar – *all of this will be taken care of by the department*
- **Cannot have any contact with the student at all** before the defense date
	 

#### Criteria:

- Must have graduated at least one PhD student
- Must be an Associate or Full Professor (need to specify the year that rank was received)
- Must come from an institution with a graduate program related to your area of study and be an "acknowledged expert" in the field
- Must not have published with, or been a collaborator on a grant in the last 6 years
- Must not be a former student of the supervisor
- Must not have had contact with the PhD candidate during the selection process 
- All this information must be available on the proposed examiner's CV or website 
	- There are some other weird specifications too – see link at the top of this section for details

#### Contacting the proposed examiner:

When the ==supervisor== – **not you** – contacts the proposed examiner...

- Confirm that they are available on the proposed date
- Ask for a copy of their CV
- Ask if they would like a digital or hard copy of the thesis
- Ask them to agree to the following statement: 

> I confirm that, if nominated, I agree to attend the candidate’s seminar and the Final Oral Exam in person or by videoconference/phone (unless, of course, serious personal circumstances prohibit this) and that I will submit a written appraisal reporton thethesis to the EEB Graduate Office at least two weeks before the defense. Thesis appraisals by external examiners consist of an analytical and constructively critical commentary on the thesis, together with an assessment of the importance of the work in relation to its field.A synopsis is not necessary, since all the examiners will have read the thesis, but if one is included it should be brief.Appraisals are typically one to two pages long, single-spaced. Mostappraisers include the major issues that they will discuss during the defense and someattach a list of minor corrections.Further details about therequirements for theappraisal report will be provided later.I will receive the thesis 6 weeks before the defense.

- Forward their response to the EEB Graduate Office
	- Nomination process will not begin until the G.O. has received this email; the potential examiner's CV, and the form 
- At least six weeks before the exam, supervisor must ask the external if they would like a digital or hard copy of the thesis
	- Kitty will send the thesis to the external and discuss honourarium/travel logistics with them 

## Thesis Defense

The *in camera* exam should be scheduled for three hours


## After the Defense

- You will get an email from SGS about how to complete the degree requirements
- Final thesis (after revisions) to be submitted to the SGS website in digital format (There is no need to submit the thesis to EEB.)
- Your degree is not considered complete until SGS receives **an email from your supervisor** saying your revisions have been completed
